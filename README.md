# Data Structure

---

## Objective

To present strategies for analysis, design, and programming of data structure allowing students to organize, manipulate, search and insert data efficiently in an application.

#### Subject Learning Results (RAC)

At the end of the course the student will be able to:

**RAC1**: Define the basic concepts of data structure.

**RAC2**: Apply the suitable data structure to solve a given problem.

## Lessons

[1. Introduction to Java](./Lessons/1.%20IntroductionToJava.md)

[2. Fundamentals of Oriented Object Programming (OOP)](./Lessons/2.%20OOP_Fundamentals.ipynb)

[3. Strings and Arrays](./Lessons/3.%20StringsAndArrays.ipynb)

[4. Multidimensional Arrays](./Lessons/4.%20MultidimensionalArrays.ipynb)

For all periods the grade is divided into: Co-evaluation (10 %), self-evaluation (10 %), and teacher evaluation (80 %) which is divided into exams (40 %) and assignments (40 %). The first and second periods are 35 % of the final grade, while for the last period it is 30 %. In the first and second periods the exam consists of two tests: one practical (60 %) and the other theoretical (40 %). 

>[!NOTE]
>You can practice and complement the course by solving programming problems in any of the following pages:
>
>- [Codeabbey](https://www.codeabbey.com/)
>- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
>- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
>
>Each problem solved, that pass all the test created for the page, can be change by points. Very simple problems are not valid.

## Assigments

All assignments will be stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/) but will be uploaded for grading on [Campus Virtual](https://campusvirtualpes.etitc.edu.co/Edusuperior/).
